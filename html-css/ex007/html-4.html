            I just wanna stay with you <br>
            It's true <br>
            All the times you say <br>
            You're my baby blue <br>
            I just wanna stay with you <br>
            It's true <br>
            All the things you do <br>
            In my home <br>
            Where my answers been waiting <br>
            I got questions <br>
            I'm frustrated <br>
            With the way you've been so tired <br>
            Of me lately, oh <br>
            Home, keep your eyes wide open <br>
            To the same lies you grew up in <br>
            With the wind out on your hair <br>
            While I'm still waiting there for my <br>
            Baby blue <br>
            I just wanna stay with you <br>
            It's true <br>
            All the things you do <br>
            Won't bring him to you <br>
            But I'll be driving home real soon <br>
            My blue <br>
            You're my baby blue <br>
            You know you play me like fool <br>
            But that's just normal for you <br>
            You give me so much hope <br>
            But still you're just my baby blue <br>
